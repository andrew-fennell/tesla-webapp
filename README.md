# tesla-webapp

# Live Demo

A live demo of this web application can be found on my website at:
https://andrewfennell.dev/projects/tesla_project/

# Usage

This is a web application that allows users to operate their Tesla vehicle without the use of their Tesla app. Even though this is intended to be on a server so it can be accessed anywhere, the client does not communicate any private data through this application. Login tokens are client side and currently are not stored at all.

# Credit

This application was developed based off of Tim Dorr's unofficial Tesla API. You can find out more about the API and how to use it on his website: https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/

This project uses cors-anywhere created by Rob Wu. You can find out more about cors-anywhere here: https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere

# Disclaimer

The basics of the application are already complete, however there is much more that can be done. All of the pages are not completely function yet. This is a work in progress. 

Understand that this is a personal project and I am building it to the best of my ability, however, this is to be used at your own risk. If you would like to see what the application does, "test" login you may use displayed on the login screen.
