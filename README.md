# tesla-webapp

This app was developed using Tim Dorr's API. You can find out more about the API and how to use it on his website: https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/

This is a web application that allows users to operate their Tesla vehicle without the use of their Tesla app. Even though this is intended to be on a server so it can be accessed anywhere, the client does not communicate any private data through this application. Login tokens are client side and currently are not stored at all.

The basics of the application are already complete, however there is much more that can be done. All of the pages are not completely function yet. This is a work in progress.
